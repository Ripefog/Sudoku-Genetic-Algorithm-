# Genetic Algorithm for Solving Sudoku

## Introduction
This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve Sudoku puzzles. GA is an optimization technique inspired by natural selection, involving selection, crossover, and mutation operations to evolve a population of potential solutions toward the correct answer.

## Features
- Uses **Cycle Crossover** to generate offspring while maintaining row constraints.
- Implements **Tournament Selection** for choosing the fittest individuals.
- Includes **Mutation** for diversity, swapping values within rows under constraints.
- Employs an **adaptive mutation rate** using Rechenberg's 1/5 Success Rule.
- Handles **9×9 Sudoku puzzles** efficiently with a structured population approach.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## How It Works
### 1. Chromosome Representation
- Each individual in the population represents a **9×9 Sudoku grid**.
- Fixed values from the given puzzle remain unchanged.
- Empty cells are filled with valid numbers, ensuring each row contains `{1,2,...,9}`.

### 2. Fitness Function
The fitness function evaluates a Sudoku grid by counting the number of conflicts in:
- Rows (already ensured to be valid)
- Columns (conflicts penalized)
- 3×3 Subgrids (conflicts penalized)
- The ideal fitness score is **1.0** (fully valid solution).

### 3. Genetic Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialize Population**: Generate 700 Sudoku grids with randomized but valid row assignments.
2. **Evaluate Fitness**: Calculate conflicts in columns and subgrids.
3. **Selection**: Use tournament selection to pick parents for reproduction.
4. **Crossover**: Apply **Cycle Crossover** to swap row segments between parents.
5. **Mutation**: Randomly swap values in a row to introduce variation.
6. **Elitism**: Retain the top 5% of best solutions each generation.
7. **Adaptive Mutation**: Adjust the mutation rate dynamically.
8. **Repeat Until Solution Found or Max Generations Reached**.

## Running the Solver
To solve a Sudoku puzzle, use the following script:

```python
import numpy as np
from SudokuGA import EvolutionarySolver

# Define a Sudoku puzzle (0 represents empty cells)
puzzle = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
])

solver = EvolutionarySolver(puzzle)
solution = solver.solve()

if solution:
    print("Sudoku Solved:")
    print(solution.values)
else:
    print("Solution not found within generation limits.")
```

## Performance Considerations
- **Works well for moderate Sudoku puzzles** with 30+ given numbers.
- **May struggle** with extremely sparse puzzles due to GA randomness.
- **Adaptive mutation** helps prevent stagnation but tuning parameters is key.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Hybrid GA + Constraint Propagation** for faster convergence.
- Optimize **column and subgrid validation** for performance gains.
- Extend support to **larger Sudoku variants (16×16, 25×25)**.

## Conclusion
This GA-based Sudoku solver demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can tackle constraint satisfaction problems. While not always as efficient as **backtracking**, it provides an alternative approach that scales well and can be improved further with hybrid techniques.
